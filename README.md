If you have never used Add-ins, you are working slowly in Excel

Have you ever used add-ins in Excel? It's a useful method, but you need to know how to write code in VBA. When I started in the HR Department, I noticed that there was a lot of manual work. So I focused on learning VBA. VBA has a simple language. Do you want to learn how to write code? If not, you can use my code. But first, you should see how it works.
In this article, I am going to show you how you can use add-ins. Because this is our first step, let's dive in.
How to Add an Add-in in Excel
Step 1: Open Excel
Open Microsoft Excel on your computer.

Step 2: Go to the Add-ins Menu
Click on the File tab in the top-left corner.
Select Options at the bottom of the left-hand menu. This will open the Excel Options window.

Step 3: Access the Add-ins Options
In the Excel Options window, select Add-ins from the list on the left side.
At the bottom of the window, you'll see a drop-down menu labeled Manage. Select Excel Add-ins from this menu and click Go.

Step 4: Add or Browse for Add-ins
A new window called Add-Ins will pop up. Here you can see a list of available add-ins.
To enable an add-in, check the box next to its name and click OK.
If the add-in you need is not listed, click Browse to locate it on your computer. Once found, select the add-in file (usually with an .xlam extension) and click OK.

Step 5: Install the Add-in
Follow any additional prompts or installation instructions that may appear. Some add-ins may require additional steps or configurations.

Now we should write a code in VBA. If you don't want to, you can find the attachments. When we write the code, we should save it in this Excel file here: C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns (For the second user, it should be your computer name). Our Excel file should be .xlsm
